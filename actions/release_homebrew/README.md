# release_homebrew

A reusable action to audit, install, test, and publish homebrew formulas to a tap.

This action is designed to work with formulas supplied by the upstream repository, instead of the tap repository.
This works better for projects where the build process often changes, and formulas are more challenging to update.

As part of an automated release workflow, this action can be used to audit, install, test, and publish the supplied
formulas to the tap repository.

Additionally, this action can be used to contribute the formula to an upstream homebrew-core repository by
creating a pull request to the upstream repository. This feature is disabled by default. To use it, you must
fork [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) and provide the `homebrew_core_fork_repo`.
You must also enable the `contribute_to_homebrew_core` input. Finally, you can modify the `upstream_homebrew_core_repo`
to point to a different repository if you are not using the official Homebrew/homebrew-core repository.

## 🚀 Basic Usage

## 🧰 Advanced Usage

It's possible to overwrite the defaults by providing additional inputs:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Validate and Publish Homebrew Formula
    uses: LizardByte/actions/actions/release_homebrew@master
    with:
      contribute_to_homebrew_core: true
      formula_file: "${{ github.workspace }}/hello_world.rb"
      git_email: ${{ secrets.GIT_EMAIL }}
      git_username: ${{ secrets.GIT_USERNAME }}
      homebrew_core_fork_repo: repo_owner/homebrew-core
      org_homebrew_repo: repo_owner/repo_name
      org_homebrew_repo_branch: master
      publish: true  # you probably want to use some conditional logic here
      token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}  # required to publish
      upstream_homebrew_core_repo: Homebrew/homebrew-core
      validate: false  # skip the audit and install steps
```

## 📝 Notes

> [!Warning]
> This action is only compatible with Linux and macOS runners, and will intentionally fail on Windows runners.

> [!Note]
> If you have a formula that is sensitive to the runner's OS version, you may wish to use a matrix strategy to run the
> action. In this case you probably only want to run the publish on one of them. Below is an example.

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false  # false to test all, true to cancel the remaining jobs if any fail
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: macos-14
          - os: macos-15
          - os: macos-26
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            publish: true
    name: Homebrew (${{ matrix.os }})
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate Formula
        shell: bash
        run: |
          # whatever you need to do to generate the formula

      - name: Validate and Publish Homebrew Formula
        uses: LizardByte/actions/actions/release_homebrew@master
        with:
          formula_file: "${{ github.workspace }}/build/hello_world.rb"
          git_email: ${{ secrets.GIT_EMAIL }}
          git_username: ${{ secrets.GIT_USERNAME }}
          org_homebrew_repo: repo_owner/repo_name
          org_homebrew_repo_branch: main
          publish: ${{ matrix.publish }}
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```
