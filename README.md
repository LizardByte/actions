### Patterns

#### Workflows

This repo has two workflows to test the actions:

- [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - A matrix is generated for each action based on the `ci-matrix.json` file in the action's directory. To add or remove
    a matrix, edit the `ci-matrix.json` file.
  - Each action should have at least one matrix defined.
  - If anything needs run before the action is run, create a `pre-ci.sh` file in the action's directory.
  - If anything needs run after the action is run, create a `post-ci.sh` file in the action's directory.
- [ci-tests.yml](.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml)
  - This workflow runs unit tests for the repo using pytest and Jest.
  - Tests should 100% cover JavaScript and Python code.

#### Action Types

This repo has two types of actions:

- **Docker**: These actions are run in a Docker container. They should have a `Dockerfile` in the action's directory.
- **Composite**: These actions are run as a series of steps in the workflow.

Additional action types can be used if necessary.

#### Action Languages

This repo has three languages used for actions:
- **Bash**: Used in portions of composite actions.
- **JavaScript**: Used in portions of composite actions.
- **Python**: Used in Docker actions and composite actions.

Additional languages can be used if necessary.
